# Plugins

In order to make a plugin, create a project implement the BankGetExchange interface

( in the InfoValutarShared repository)

The result will be a dll and a bunch of files .

Make a folder into the current directory ( with the same name as the dll ) and copy all files and the dll inside

That will be all!

## Example

See the projects InfoValutarECB and InfoValutarNBR
